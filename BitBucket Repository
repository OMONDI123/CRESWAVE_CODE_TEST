INSTALLING AND SETTING UP MYSQL SERVER WITH PHPMYADMIN

First install mysql server
sudo apt install mysql

Update Package Index:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
Install phpMyAdmin:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install phpmyadmin
During the installation, you'll be prompted to choose a web server. Select apache2 by pressing the space bar and then hit Enter.

You'll also be prompted to configure the database for phpMyAdmin with dbconfig-common. Choose Yes and then enter your MySQL root password when prompted.

Complete the installation process.

Configure Apache:
By default, phpMyAdmin is accessible only from the localhost. If you want to access it from a remote machine, you need to edit the Apache configuration file. Open the Apache configuration file:

bash
Copy code
sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
Add the following line at the end of the file to allow access from your IP address (replace xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with your actual IP address):

bash
Copy code
Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
Save the file and exit the editor.

Restart Apache:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart apache2
Now you should be able to access phpMyAdmin by navigating to http://your_server_ip/phpmyadmin in your web browser.

If you encounter any issues during the installation or configuration, let me know!
